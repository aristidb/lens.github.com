The first NY Haskell Users Group meetup was a great success -- with
<br/>roughly sixty attendees and conversations that stretched far too late
<br/>for a weekday night. Video and slides are available for both the
<br/>Practical Data Processing and Cloud Haskell talks:

<br/>We're actively seeking cool talks and presentations. If you're not a
<br/>New York local, but may be passing through or are in the tri-state
<br/>area or thereabouts, and would like to present some code or research
<br/>with even tangentially real-world implications to an informed and
<br/>appreciated audience, please do get in touch :-)
<br/><br/>Also, there will be a NY tech holiday party on December 11th, which we
<br/>are organizing along with other NY technology and PL groups. Details
<br/>are available at the on the meetup site:
<br/><a href="http://www.meetup.com/NY-Haskell/" target="_top" rel="nofollow" link="external">http://www.meetup.com/NY-Haskell/</a>. Finally, at some point, we will
<br/>probably cease to spam -cafe with announcements of all our events, so
<br/>even if you can't make it to the next few ones, registering at the
<br/>meetup site is the best way to stay on top of what we will have
<br/>planned.

<br/><br/>Lenses, Folds, and Traversals
<br/>presented by Edward Kmett
<br/><br/>Wednesday, December 12, 2012
<br/>7:00 PM To 9:00 PM
<br/><br/>Pivotal Labs, 841 Broadway New York, NY
<br/>(8th Floor)
<br/><br/>RSVP: <a href="http://www.meetup.com/NY-Haskell/" target="_top" rel="nofollow" link="external">http://www.meetup.com/NY-Haskell/</a><br/><br/>Edward Kmett will introduce his lens library, which provides a highly
<br/>composable toolbox for accessing and modifying multiple parts of data
<br/>structures.
<br/><br/>From simple beginnings, starting with building blocks such as fmap and
<br/>(.), we will build up combinators suitable for working with a wide
<br/>array of data structures. These generalize the notions you already
<br/>know how to use into a form that is easier to compose, and
<br/>simultaneously allow them to be used for monomorphic containers such
<br/>as Data.Text. All without compromising on your ability to reason about
<br/>them using laws!
<br/><br/>Once we've built up some foundations, we'll do a bit of a deep dive,
<br/>exploring consequences of this design. We will discuss the efficient
<br/>generic programming programming framework exported by lens, and
<br/>type-safe Traversal-based zippers.
<br/><br/>Familiarity with the Applicative and Traversable classes from the
<br/>Haskell base libraries will be helpful (links provided below), but a
<br/>basic understanding of the concepts will be introduced we go along.
<br/>Attendees should expect to be gobsmacked with a newfound appreciation
<br/>for the power of a little (or a lot of) abstraction.
